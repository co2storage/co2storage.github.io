When CO₂ expands from high to low pressure (as it does during injection into a depleted reservoir), it undergoes cooling. This cooling can be substantial, with temperature drops of 5-15°C commonly observed in field operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial P} \\\\right)_H = \\\\frac{1}{C_p} \\\\left[ T \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial T} \\\\right)_P - V \\\\right] $$\\r\\n\\r\\nThe implications of this cooling include:\\r\\n- Risk of hydrate formation when water is present\\r\\n- Potential for freezing near the wellbore\\r\\n- Changes to mechanical properties of surrounding formations\\r\\n- Thermal contraction of wellbore materials\";"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
