When CO₂ expands from high to low pressure (as it does during injection into a depleted reservoir), it undergoes cooling. This cooling can be substantial, with temperature drops of 5-15°C commonly observed in field operations.\r\n\r\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial P} \\right)_H = \\frac{1}{C_p} \\left[ T \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T} \\right)_P - V \\right] $$\r\n\r\nThe implications of this cooling include:\r\n- Risk of hydrate formation when water is present\r\n- Potential for freezing near the wellbore\r\n- Changes to mechanical properties of surrounding formations\r\n- Thermal contraction of wellbore materials"}}]);
